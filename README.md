## kanjiDamage Web Scraping 

For *scraping* One can Refer [Link](https://www.edureka.co/blog/web-scraping-with-python/) 

# There are two pages namely [kanjiDamage](http://www.kanjidamage.com/kanji) and [nihongopro](https://www.nihongo-pro.com/kanji-pal/list/jlpt)

from the given japenese languages notations at the kanjiDamage page We have to take one notation from that page and have to 
copy &paste the notation from the nihangopro search this way We can decide the level of word whether it is N5, N4 or N3


so instead of copy and paste the symbols from one tab to another tab I have created one csv file which include only the table for the 
N5,N4 and N3 notations
